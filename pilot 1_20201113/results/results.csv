I suppose I was thinking that there might be lots of creatures on the planet%2C so I expressed 0 surprise if the thing that was mentioned seemed completely possible%2C even if it might not be the "majority" feature. I hope this doesn't skew things too much. I also hope it doesn't skew things too much that I'm a mathematician and might have a different attitude to "if...then" statements compared to "normal" people.
