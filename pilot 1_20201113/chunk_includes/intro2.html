You will read 4 different stories about aliens from different planets, far away from the Earth, and a statement characterizing an individual from each of those planets.
</p>
  
  
<p >
Afterwards, you will receive two new pieces of information,  <b>one at a time</b>. Given what you were already told about the aliens, how <b>surprised</b> would you be to learn each of these new pieces of information?  
</p>

<p >
For example, suppose you had previously been told that “Katie recently got divorced”. You might be <i>very surprised</i> if you later found out that she had never been never married, but <i>not surprised at all</i> to learn that Katie was unhappy with her marriage. 
</p>
  
<p >
Your job is provide a rating for the statements on a scale <b>from 0 to 100</b>, with 0 being <i>not surprised at all</i> and 100 being <i> totally surprised</i>.
