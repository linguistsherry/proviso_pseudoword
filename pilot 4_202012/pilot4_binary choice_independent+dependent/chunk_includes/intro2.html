Imagine that you are a reporter on extra-terrestrial matters trying to learn things about life outside our galaxy. The aliens on other planets have a different culture and a different language, so you may encounter words that you have never heard of in English -- Don't worry about that, because we are more interested in how you understand the situations.
  </p>

<p >
You are travelling to different planets far away from the Earth, where you will interview an alien resident. In this task, you'll be asked to evaluate new, hypothetical information that you may learn about your interview subject, given what you had previously learned about the aliens on their planet.

Suppose you were to learn this new information, would you find it <b>surprising</b>, given what you learned? Select 'Yes' or 'No' to respond.
