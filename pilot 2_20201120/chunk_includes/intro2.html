<p >
As an adventurous journalist, you are travelling to 5 different planets far away from the Earth, to learn about alien cultures. 
</p>
  
  <p >
On each planet, you will first receive general information characterizing the aliens living on that planet. You will also interview a particular alien there who you've collected some information about.
</p>
  
  
<p >
Over the course of the interview, you will learn 2 new, separate things about this alien, <b>one at a time</b>. You job is to decide how <b>unexpected</b> you would find this new information, given what you previously learned about the aliens on this planet.

</p>
  
<p >
For example, suppose you have been told that “Katie recently got divorced”. When you interview Katie, you should find it <i>completely unexpected</i> if you found out that Katie had actually never been married, but <i>not unexpected at all</i> to learn that Katie was unhappy with her marriage. 
</p>
  
<p >
Your job is provide a rating on a scale <b>from 0 to 100</b>, with 0 being <i>not unexpected at all</i>, 50 being <i>somewhat unexpected</i>, and 100 being <i> completely unexpected</i>.
